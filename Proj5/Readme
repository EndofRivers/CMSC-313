1. Expected inputs/outputs
************************************************************************

[nlong2@linux1 proj5] make test
./test.sh
============
Program output matches expected

2. How to compile and use this project
************************************************************************

Compilation

nasm -f	elf64 -g -F dwarf bookcmp.asm
gcc -g driver.c	proj5.c	bookcmp.o -o proj5

Used the makefile provided

Usage

To run the assignment type,

make test

into the console

3. Functionality (describe your contributions here)
************************************************************************

In proj5.c, the only contribution is naming the variables then iterating
over the books to print them out

In bookcmp.asm, we were required to first compare the years to see if
they were same or not. Then if they are the same year, sort them by
title. If not, then do not sort.

The comparison by title was a minor challenge. I iterated over the title
names using the rcx register. This loop feels similar to a for loop.
If the comparison resulted in less than, then you jump to L_lt and the
same for greater than and L_gt. This will sort the list via qsort


************************************************************************
4. Limitations (if any)
************************************************************************

All tests passed

5. Applications (your thoughts) of this project
************************************************************************

Sorting is vital to computer science. The world likes it when things are
sorted. But not just any kind of sorted, they want it sorted in a
specific way that benefits them. That's where a computer scientist comes
in and gets all their data the way they want it. This of course then
spurred the race of efficiency for said sorts.
